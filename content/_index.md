Hi, I'm Simon. I live in Nantes, France where I work remotely as a freelance 
Software Engineer. I have a strong background in Machine Learning and software 
development. These days I spend most of my time working with 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and 
[gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) for embedded computer vision.
