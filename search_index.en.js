I'm Simon. I live in Nantes, France where I work remotely as a freelance Software Engineer. I have a strong background in Machine Learning and software development, these days I'm mostly interested in building iOS apps with SwiftUI and CoreML.\nOn my spare time I workout a lot, hike and cycle, teach STEM to school children, try to grow veggies and I love to travel with a tiny backpack.\n","id":"https://simonguillot.com/","title":"Home"},"https://simonguillot.com/articles/":{"body":"","id":"https://simonguillot.com/articles/","title":"Articles"},"https://simonguillot.com/articles/c-ndarrays/":{"body":"The grammar of C is messy and some constructions can be counter-intuitive for \nbeginners: this is the case of multidimensional arrays (non-programmers would \ncall them tensors).\nIntroduction\nSomeone new to low-level programming would be tempted to declare arrays with \nmultiple dimensions in the following way:\nfloat*** make_3d_float_array(size_t x, size_t y, size_t z) {\n    float*** A = malloc(x*sizeof(float**));\n\n    for (...) {\n        A[i] = malloc(... // I think you know the rest...\n\nEven though the syntax for accessing cells is the same as for static arrays, \nthat's not the best thing to do: unless you're planning to replace entire rows \nor planes more often than you do random accesses, this is inefficient. We need \ncontiguous arrays without having to explicitly compute the indexes.\nWhile learning C and experimenting with metaprogramming, I wrote a few \nhelpers using the preprocessor for dynamic \nmultidimensional arrays. If you take a look at it without much knowledge of the \nC preprocessor, you'll probably see it as mostly voodoo. Fortunately C99 comes \nwith syntactic sugar that makes this unnecessary. Read on !\nStatic arrays\nAs a reminder, static arrays means we are putting the size of the array in its \ntype. A static 2D arrays of integers can be declared and used as such:\nvoid foo(int x[4][2]) {\n    // Do something with x.\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int x[4][2];\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(x) / sizeof(x[0]); i++)\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; sizeof(x) / sizeof(x[0][0]); j++)\n            x[i][j] = rand();\n\n    foo(x);\n    // Don't be fooled by the syntax of foo's argument,\n    // there's no copy of x involved!\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAlthough the syntax may be deceiving, the array is not copied when calling the \nfunction. And there's no way to ask for an implicit copy.\nWhat about dynamic arrays, for which the size may not be known at compile time ?\nProper dynamic arrays\nIn C99, variable length arrays can be declared and allocated as follow:\nint m = rand() % 10 + 1;\nint n = rand() % 10 + 1;\n\nprintf(\"m = %d, n = %d\\n\", m, n);\n\nint x[m][n];\nint (*y)[n] = malloc(m * n * sizeof(y[0][0]));\nint (*z)[m][n] = malloc(sizeof(*z));\n\nx is a dynamic (i.e. variable-length) array allocated on the stack. y and \nz are both pointers to chunks of memory allocated in the heap (which are the \nsize of x) but the semantic slightly differs between the two: the type of the \ndata y points to is an array of n integers, while z points to an array \nof m arrays of n integers.\nIf you're not comfortable with pointer arithmetic, you may want to read this \ntutorial.\nCell accesses are written as such:\nx[i][j] = 42;\ny[i][j] = 42;\n(*z)[i][j] = 42; // same as z[0][i][j] ;)\n\nEven though the semantic of z is, in some way, closer to what we're \nexpressing, its usage is less practical.\nHow can we write functions taking dynamic arrays as arguments ? This is were the \nreal syntax tricks hide: we can put the lengths as arguments and use them in the \ntype of the array. For more details on it, read this GCC man \npage.\nIn plain C99:\nvoid foo(int m, int n, int x[m][n]) {\n    // Do something with x.\n}\n\n// ...\n\nfoo(m, n, x);\nfoo(m, n, y);\nfoo(m, n, *z);\n\nAgain, the arrays are not copied.\nFinally, GCC provides an elegant extension to put the size arguments after the \narray, which may lead to more readable code in some cases:\nvoid bar(int m, int n; int x[m][n], int m, int n) {\n    // Do something with x.\n}\n\n// ...\n\nbar(x, m, n);\n\nA full working example of this is available here.\n","id":"https://simonguillot.com/articles/c-ndarrays/","title":"N-dimensional arrays in C"},"https://simonguillot.com/articles/jetson-vagrant/":{"body":"This post is intended for those who want to flash their Jetson TX2 board\nfrom an Ubuntu VM without a desktop environment running.\nSetting up a Jetson TX2 must be done through NVidia's\nSDK Manager.

The first goal of this work is to assist \nthe tracking of the orientation of a device by taking into account the multiple \ndistortions of the field observed indoor: this is a step toward a positioning \nalgorithm that takes advantage of these anomalies.\nMaxwell's equations and the magnetic scalar potential\nIn order to be plausible, an approximation of the magnetic field should obey \nsome properties well known by physicists. All electromagnetic phenomena are \ngoverned by Maxwell's \nequations, \ntwo of them involve the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot B = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\times B = \\mu_0 \\left(J + \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the magnetic field, $\\mu_0$ \nand $\\epsilon_0$ are respectively the permeability and permittivity of vacuum, \n$J$ is the current density and $E$ the electric field. \nThe first of these two laws states that the magnetic field is divergence free, \nin other words, magnetic monopoles do not exist. We are assuming that there is \nno free current in the air and no time-dependent effects due to moving electric \ncharges, thus the AmpÃ¨re's circuital law reduces to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times B = 0\n$$\nIn these conditions, the magnetic field is then said to be irrotational. An \nirrotational vector field can be fully described as the gradient of a scalar \nfield, called a scalar potential:\n$$\nB = - \\nabla \\psi\n$$\nThus, by modeling $\\psi$ in place of $B$ directly, we are implicitly modeling a \nvector field that follows the second law.12 The first law will \nbe added as a regularization in the optimization procedure.\n1\nNiklas WahlstrÃ¶m et al., \"Modeling magnetic fields using Gaussian \nProcesses\", 2013 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal \nProcessing (ICASSP)\n\n2\nArno Solin et al., \"Modeling and interpolation of the ambient magnetic \nfield by Gaussian processes\", arXiv:1509.04634\n\nDifferentiable interpolation\nThe map is represented by a set of anchor points $M = {(c_k, w_k) | k \\in [1, \nK]}$, where $c_k$ is the position of the anchor in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $w_k$ its \nassociated value â a scalar potential in this case.\nIn order to have a model differentiable with respect to the position and the \nelements of the map $M$, the interpolation function \nis defined to be in the form:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^K w_k \\phi(x, c_k)\n$$\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a point in space, $w_k$ the value of the map at \nthe anchor $k$ located in position $c_k$, and $\\phi \\in (\\mathbb{R}^2, \n\\mathbb{R}^2) \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ is a differentiable radial basis function: it \ngives a weight to the anchors depending on their distance to the point $x$.  In \nessence, this approach is similar to the attention mechanism in deep \nlearning.3\nWith this definition of the scalar potential function $\\psi$, the estimated \nmagnetic field $B$ is:\n$$\nB(x) = \\nabla_x \\psi(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^K w_k \\nabla_x \\phi(x, c_k)\n$$\n\nWe dropped the negative sign to simplify the equations even though this not \nstandard among mathematicians and physicists, however the true value of the \npotential is of little interest to our application.\n\n3\nOlah &amp; Carter, \"Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural \nNetworks\", Distill, 2016. http://distill.pub/2016/augmented-rnns/\n\nRadial basis functions\nA radial basis function satisfies the property $\\phi(x) = \\phi(||x||)$: its \nvalue depends only on the distance from the origin â or another point called the \ncenter.

While their performance remains mostly unchallenged for applications that involve a high-dimensional input, deploying them in environments with limited computing power requires additional work. The first job is to reduce the algorithmic complexity of the model, that'll more likely be the job of a Data Scientist as it usually comes at a cost in accuracy that must be evaluated. In a second part a well-rounded Developer or Machine Learning Engineer must take that model and convert it to a format compatible with the inference platform of their choosing. Bellow are a few tricks I learned from experience.\nDeploying a PyTorch model to iOS with CoreML will be the topic of a tutorial I'll publish soon, stay tuned! ð\nCompressing the model\nThree main techniques are used to reduce the overall computing power required by a neural networks: quantisation, weights pruning and knowledge distillation (see Compressing BERT for faster prediction  and Introducing DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT for an in-depth introduction).\nQuantisation is the process of reducing the precision of a model's parameters and operations to save memory and take advantage of wider parallelisation of arithmetic operations. It can be done through the usage of smaller floating-point types (typically half-precision, ie. 2 bytes instead of 4) or fixed-point operations: the former only increases rounding errors, whereas the latter requires choosing the range in which the computations are going to happen. To avoid hurting the model's performance too much, quantisation should be accounted for during training. When doing Quantisation Aware Training, the training process is roughly the following:\n\nQuantise the model's weights\nCompute the loss with the quantised version of the network\nCompute the gradient w.r.t the unquantised weights\nUpdate the unquantised weights\nRepeat\n\nIn PyTorch, quantisation can be done statically (converting a model beforehand) or dynamically (converting an intermediate output to a quantised version then back during inference) and is described in this tutorial of the framework's blog.\nWeights pruning removes part of the model that have little contribution to the end result. Removing individual weights has no interest in the absence of an efficient implementation of sparse matrices operations, whereas pruning neurons entirely amounts to removing entire rows or columns of a weight matrix. In some cases, pruning entire weight matrices seems to be doable without much loss in accuracy. The decision can be taken by measuring both the neurons activations and error gradients during inference on a representative dataset. Alternating between pruning and training steps allows for the remaining neurons to compensate. PyTorch's documentation again has a good tutorial on the topic.\nFinally, knowledge distillation is the process of learning a smaller model from the output of a bigger one. While being introduced six years ago by Geoffrey Hinton, this methods seems to still be heavily used: it works well in practice to have a thiner and deeper distilled model (see also here and there for a lot of advice on the topic). The key insight to take away from these techniques is that they work well because of the added informations that can be used during training: for instance a classifier is trained as a regression task over the whole probability distribution over all classes of the output of original model, we can also use unlabelled examples on top of the usual training data set.\nRuntimes and conversions\nIn this article I'm only considering models designed with PyTorch and Tensorflow. These two frameworks have dedicated libraries to run the inference on devices: Tensorflow-Lite and PyTorch-Mobile. The upside of choosing these engines to run your models is that the compatibility with the possible model architectures is excellent. The downside is that they are much less portable and most of the time don't take advantage of the dedicated hardware of your devices.\nDepending on the device, a few more platforms are available to choose from: MLKit on Android, Tract that is cross-platform, OpenVINO on Intel products, TensorRT on NVidia's hardware, CoreML on Apple devices, etc.\nThe main problem with all these target-specific platforms is their usability: they support only a (not so large) subset of operations available of PyTorch and Tensorflow, and the quality of the toolchain is usually substandard. However, the huge upside of these is, I reiterate, the ability to take full advantage of your hardware and other capabilities of the device: as of now CoreML is for instance the only way to use the Neural Engine of Apple products. So in most cases, converting a model from the Data Scientist' environment to the appropriate format should not be considered to be a straightforward and easy task.\nThere are a many paths to end-up with a model that runs \"natively\" on the environment of your choosing, a few are given bellow (the easy paths are shown in green, the harder ones in red):\n\nExporting the model\nWith PyTorch, exporting a model usually goes through TorchScript. The official documentation has a very good quick introduction but here are a few tips that should make the process easier:\n\nIt is possible to either \"script\" or \"trace\" a model. Tracing gives more constrains on the flow of data through the model and how tensors can be dealt, that avoids quite a few operations that may be problematic further down the line when converting the model to the final format of the inference engine.\nAvoid as much as possible operations that are depending on the nature of the tensors: their shape, type of data, etc. For instance don't use the size property of the tensor to compute an average but choose the adaptative operations that already exist in the framework.\nWhen converting a model that works on sequences, the padding and packing operations (necessary only to train on batches of samples) should not appear on the graph to export: keep a specific path for inference that avoids all these problematic tinkering with the input.\n\nThe following advice are also relevant if you are dealing with Tensorflow:\n\nSome operations are more exotic that others, replacing them by a similar but more common one can help. For instance, a hard sigmoid isn't as common as a regular sigmoid. If the gain in accuracy is marginal, it may not be relevant to keep it. If it does help during training, changing it only at the time of inference is a good idea. Obviously, this kind of changes won't give you results identical to the original model so their impact need to be measured!\nTo avoid many easy mistakes developers may do (and use your hardware as much as you can!), it is a rather good idea to include all preprocessing operations in the computation graph. Typically, normalising the input should be included in your exported model.\n\nIn a broader sense, the less original your model is, the easier it will be to deploy it: all the operations and architectures that are common in the most popular image and natural language processing models have good chances of being easy to convert without much difficulty.\nTake the LSTM as an example: it has been around for decades now thus it is very well supported in many environment. If implemented without modification in PyTorch or Tensorflow, it will end up being a single computation node in the exported graph. However, a fair amount of publications are slightly modifying its activation function for a gain that is, once again, marginal. If that isn't supported by the targeted engine, a single node now became a dozen of potentially problematic primitive operations.\nTLDR;\nIt is mandatory to take into account the target environment when building a model:\n\nSome architectures should be ruled out straight away as they may not be realistic to run on your platform\nReducing the computational cost needs to be done during training\nIn almost every case your model's computation graph will need to be modified\n\nIntegrating the whole deployment process in the model development cycle is thus by far one of the best decision you can make: whomever is designing the models will be able to make the necessary compromises early on and the uncertainty on the time required to put the model in production will be greatly reduced.\n","id":"https://simonguillot.com/articles/nn-edge-deployment-intro/","title":"A pouch of tricks to deploy neural nets on mobile devices"},"https://simonguillot.com/contact/":{"body":"\n  \n    Your email:\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Your message:\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Submit\n    \n  \n","id":"https://simonguillot.com/contact/","title":"Contact"},"https://simonguillot.com/cv/":{"body":"If you browser doesn't display my CV appropriately, you can download it instead.
