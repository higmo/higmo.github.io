Hi, I'm Simon. I live in Nantes, France where I work remotely as a freelance 
Software Engineer. I have a strong background in machine learning and software 
development. These days I spend most of my time working with 
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [gstreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org) for
computer vision on the edge.

If you have some specific needs I could address, please reach out to [Eigenscape](https://eigenscape.com).
