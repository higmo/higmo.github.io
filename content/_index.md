Hi, I'm Simon. I live in Nantes, France where I work remotely as a freelance Software Engineer. I have a strong background in Machine Learning and software development, these days I'm mostly interested in building iOS apps with SwiftUI and CoreML.

On my spare time I workout a lot, hike and cycle, teach STEM to school children, try to grow veggies and I love to travel with a tiny backpack.
